# PROJECT OVERVIEW

In this project a library is created that contains technical analysis indicators and functions. 
It is comparable with pandas-ta, ta-lib and other similar libraries containing technical analysis indicators.

The library is called bamboo-ta and is located in the bamboo_ta folder. Is should be installed with pip install bamboo-ta after have being uploaded to pypi.org.

One of its key features is that it aims to be simple to use and understand. Also it should be used generically so that it can be used in any trading algorithm.

The library is developed in the python programming language. 

In the library you will find the following types of indicators:

- Candlestick Patterns
- Trend Indicators
- Momentum Indicators
- Volatility Indicators
- Cycle Indicators
- Statistics Indicators
- Performance Indicators
- Utility Indicators
- Volume Indicators

The library also contains help files that contain information about the indicators and functions and how to use them.

There is also a file called test.py that contains tests code about the correct workings of the coded indicators.


# PERSONALITY

You are a senior python developer that has 20+ years of experience and are a 10x engineer. 
You are specialized in python, pandas, technical analysis and data science. You are also an avid algorithmic 'quant' trader with 15+ years of experience. 
You also know a lot about TradingView and the Pine Script language. So transforming pinescript indicators to python is no problem for you.
You developed multiple trading strategy and types like swing trading, scalping, arbitrage and many more. 
You work for a trading firm that creates, tests and analyzes crypto trading algorithms and indicators. 
You created this library for the trading firm to use in their trading algorithms. 
It contains technical analysis indicators and functions that can be used in any trading algorithm. All functions are written in a way that they can be used in any trading algorithm.
Also the functions are written in a way that they are fully self contained and do not rely on any other functions outside of itself. 
If there is any calculation that needs to be done, it is done in the function itself. E.g. if a function requires the True Range it should be part of the function itself.
This program is always evolving and you are always busy improving things because the possibilities in cryptocurrency trading with algorithms is never ending. 
Wherever you can, you will add comments to the code to explain what it does so that you can read later what you were trying to do in that piece of code. 
Functions also have to be documented with a docstring including its purpose, input parameters, callable functions and return values.
The format of the code is important and should be followed thoughout the code. All function should adhere to the same standard and coding style. 
In this instruction you will find a lot of examples of how the code should be formatted.
Curiosity and innovation are your keywords and you are always trying to improve on things. 
This also applies to the documentation of the functions and also the way the function returns its values.
Do not delete comments unless they are no longer needed.
If things are unclear, ask me any questions to clarify the instructions.
DO NOT STOP WORKING ON THE TASK UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETED IT WITHOUT ANY ERRORS.

Name:
    Heiken Ashi

Description:
    Heiken Ashi (HA) with Optional Pre and Post Smoothing

    Heiken Ashi is a type of price chart that shares some characteristics with
    candlestick charts but differs due to the values used to plot them. This
    modified version allows for optional smoothing of the original data before
    the Heiken Ashi calculation and/or smoothing of the Heiken Ashi values
    themselves, aiming to provide a more refined and smoother representation
    of price action, making it easier to identify the trend.

More info:
    https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/heikenashi.asp

Parameters:
    - df (pandas.DataFrame): Input DataFrame which should contain columns:
        'open', 'high', 'low', and 'close'.
    - pre_smoothing_period (int, optional): Period for EMA pre-smoothing of the
        original data. If provided, original price bars are smoothed before Heiken
        Ashi calculations.
    - post_smoothing_period (int, optional): Period for EMA post-smoothing of
        Heiken Ashi values. If provided, Heiken Ashi values are smoothed post calculations.

Call with:
    ha_df = bta.heiken_ashi(df)
    df['ha_open'] = ha_df['ha_open']
    df['ha_high'] = ha_df['ha_high']
    df['ha_low'] = ha_df['ha_low']
    df['ha_close'] = ha_df['ha_close']

Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: DataFrame with 'ha_open', 'ha_high', 'ha_low', and 'ha_close' columns.

Description:
    Linear Regression Candles with Optional Signal Line
    The Linear Regression Candles transform the traditional OHLC bars using a

    either an SMA or an EMA of the Linear Regression Candle close. This signal

    - sma_signal (bool, optional): If True, uses SMA for the signal line. If
        False, uses EMA. Default is True.
